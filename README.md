# Valorant-AntiCheat-Disabler
A small EXE that will disable Valorant's AntiCheat when you don't want it running

### About
This a solution to solving Valorant's Anti-Cheat solution. It will start up and load to files, one being the anti-cheat itself
and the other being the system try applicaiton

My program disables those files (and anythin attached to them) from being loaded once your computer reboots, allowing it
to run without the anti-cheat loaded

## Releases
To get the newest version of the compiled program, go to 'https://github.com/TylerLyczak/Valorant-AntiCheat-Disabler/releases'

If you feel unsure about using a random exe from a github (I feel the same way), then clone the project and compile the code yourself

### Future Updates
* Working GUI implementation
* Edit registries so there is no start up process related to the anti-cheat
